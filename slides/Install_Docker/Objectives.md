## Lesson ~~~SECTION:MAJOR~~~: Installing Docker

### Objectives

At the end of this lesson, you will know:

* How to install Docker.
* When to use `sudo` when running Docker commands.

*Note:* if you were provided with a training VM for a hands-on
tutorial, you can skip this chapter, since that VM already
has Docker installed, and Docker has already been setup to run
without ``sudo``.

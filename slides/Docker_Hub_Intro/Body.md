# Sign up for a Docker Hub account

Note: if you already have an account on the Index/Hub, don't create another one.

- Having a Docker Hub account will allow us to store our images in the registry.
- To sign up, you'll go to [hub.docker.com](http://hub.docker.com) and fill out the form.
- Note: your Docker Hub username has to be all lowercase.

# Activate your account through e-mail.

- Check your e-mail and click the confirmation link.

# Login
Let's use our new account to login to the Docker Hub!

    @@@ Sh
    $ docker login
    Username: my_docker_hub_login
    Password:
    Email: my@email.com
    Login Succeeded

Our credentials will be stored in ``~/.dockercfg``.

<!SLIDE>
# The ``.dockercfg`` configuration file

The ``~/.dockercfg`` configuration file holds our Docker registry
authentication credentials.

    @@@ Sh
    {
      "https://index.docker.io/v1/": {
        "auth":"amFtdHVyMDE6aTliMUw5ckE=",
        "email":"education@docker.com"
      }
    }

The ``auth`` section is Base64 encoding of your user name and password.

It should be owned by your user with permissions of ``0600``.

**You should protect this file!**

# Repositories

- Apply to your namespace
- Empty!

![Repositories](blankrepositories.png)

<!SLIDE>
# Public Repositories

- Docker Hub provides access to tens of thousands of pre-made images that you can build from.
- Some of these are `official builds` and live in the root namespace.
- Most are community contributed and maintained.

![Public Repositories](publicrepos.png)

<!SLIDE>
# Official Repositories

- Are maintained by the product owners
- Blessed by Docker

- Give your repository a name
- Type a brief description so people know what it is
- Leave `Public` selected

![Repository Form](addrepo2.png)

<!SLIDE>
# New Repository (3/3)

# Repository Settings

You can change the following:

- Repository Description
- Webhooks
- Collaborators
- Mark as unlisted in the global search (NOT a private repository)

![Repository Settings](settings.png)

<!SLIDE>
# Collaborators

You can invite other Docker Hub to collaborate on your projects.

- Collaborators cannot change settings in the repository.
- Collaborators can push images to the repository.

![Collaborators](collab.png)

<!SLIDE>
# Webhooks

- Notify external applications that an image has been uploaded to the repository.
- Powerful tool for integrating with your development workflow.
- Even more powerful when used with Automated Builds.

![Webhooks](webhooks.png)

<!SLIDE>
# Automated Builds

- Automatically build an image when source code is changed.
- Integrated with Github and Bitbucket
- Work with public and private repositories
- Add the same as a regular repository, select `Automated Build` from the `Add Repository` menu
- We'll set one of these up later!
    - You will need a Github account to follow along later, so go ahead and create one now if you don't
      have one yet.
